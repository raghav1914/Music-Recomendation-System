# Music-Recomendation-System

I’ve developed a Python-based solution to recommend songs by analyzing lyrical content. Utilizing Python for efficient data processing and advanced natural language processing techniques, I've created a system that provides personalized music recommendations with high accuracy.

Dataset Preparation and Training:
I began with a dataset containing over 5,000 songs. After handling null values, I applied tokenization and stemming to prepare the text data. Using TF-IDF vectorization, I converted the lyrics into a structured format suitable for similarity analysis. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets to ensure model validation.

Model Training and Integration:
Using cosine similarity measures, I built a model to recommend songs based on lyrical content. The system demonstrated robust performance during testing, accurately identifying similar songs and ensuring reliability in real-world applications.

Personalized Music Recommendations:
The system analyzes the input song’s lyrics and recommends similar songs by calculating the cosine similarity between their TF-IDF vectors. This feature enhances user experience by providing tailored music suggestions that match their preferences.

Usage:
Input a song name to receive a list of recommended songs with similar lyrical themes. The system dynamically analyzes the lyrics and provides instant suggestions, making it easier to discover new music that aligns with your taste.
